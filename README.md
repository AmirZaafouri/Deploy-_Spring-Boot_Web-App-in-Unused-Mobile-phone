# Deploying Spring Boot + MySQL on Unused phone

This guide explains how to set up and deploy a Spring Boot application with MySQL on an Ubuntu environment running inside UserLAnd on an Android device.

## Prerequisites

- Android device with [UserLAnd](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tech.ula) installed.
- Basic knowledge of Linux commands.
- A Spring Boot application with a Maven build structure.

---
## ðŸ’¡. You Can setup Acess SSH for easy use of cmd
install openssh-server in your ubuntu in mobile phone:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install openssh-server -y
```
change port of ssh access because will create some conflict with userland Session ðŸ™‚:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```
Change this line:
```bash
Port 22
```
to:
```bash
Port 2222
```
Then restart SSH:
```bash
sudo service ssh restart
```
start ssh service :
```bash
sudo service ssh start
```
# Connect to SSH from Your PC
On your PC, open a terminal (Linux/macOS) or PowerShell (Windows) and run:
```bash
ssh -p 2222 username@IP_phone
```

## 1. Install Required Packages

Update and install the necessary packages:
In my case, I have created a Spring Boot application with Java 8 structure using Maven and MySQL(database).

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk maven mysql-server -y
```

Verify Java installation:

```bash
java -version
```

If needed, configure Java manually:

```bash
sudo update-alternatives --config java
```

---

## 2. Set Up MySQL

UserLAnd does not support MySQL as a service, so it must be started manually:

```bash
sudo mysqld_safe --skip-networking &
```

Secure MySQL installation:

```bash
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

Create a database and user for the Spring Boot application:
in my case my data base configured with name stationSki on proroprete file
```sql
CREATE DATABASE stationSki;
CREATE USER 'myuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'TypeYourpassword';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON mydb.* TO 'myuser'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

Exit MySQL:

```bash
exit
```

---

## 3. Deploy Spring Boot Application

Clone or upload your Spring Boot project inside UserLAnd:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AmirZaafouri/Deploy-_Spring-Boot_Web-App-in-Unused-Mobile-phone
cd Deploy-_Spring-Boot_Web-App-in-Unused-Mobile-phone
```

Build the project:
Without sudo, you will get an error because it requires changes (updating, deleting, or adding dependencies)
```bash
sudo mvn clean package
```

Run the application:
by using * it's automticly take anything end with extenstion .jar => livrable
```bash
java -jar target/*.jar
```

---

## 4. Access the Application

Find your local IP address:

```bash
ip a | grep inet
```

Access the application from any device connect to the same Network with browser:

```
http://@IP_phone:8088
```

If needed, check running processes and ports:

```bash
netstat -tulnp
```

---

## Troubleshooting

- **MySQL not starting?** Try:
  ```bash
  sudo mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables &
  ```
- **Port conflicts?** Check active ports:
  ```bash
  netstat -tulnp
  ```
- **Application not accessible?** Consider using SSH tunneling or a reverse proxy.

## Conclusion

we have successfully deployed a Spring Boot + MySQL application on UserLAnd Ubuntu. ðŸŽ‰ If you have any issues or improvements, feel free to contribute or raise an issue in this repository!

ðŸš€ Happy Coding!
